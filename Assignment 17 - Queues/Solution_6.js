// ðŸ’¡ **Question 6**

// You are given an integer arrayÂ `deck`. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on theÂ `ith`Â card isÂ `deck[i]`.

// You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

// You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

// 1. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
// 2. If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
// 3. If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.

// ReturnÂ *an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order*.

// **Note**Â that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

// **Example 1:**

// Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
// Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
// Explanation:
// We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
// After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
// We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
// We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
// We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
// We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
// We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
// We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
// We reveal 17.
// Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.

// **Example 2:**
// Input: deck = [1,1000]
// Output: [1,1000]

function deckRevealedIncreasing(deck) {
  deck.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sort the deck in ascending order

  const queue = []; // Queue to store the indices of the cards
  const result = new Array(deck.length).fill(0); // Array to store the final ordering of the deck

  for (let i = 0; i < deck.length; i++) {
    queue.push(i); // Enqueue the indices of the cards
  }

  for (const card of deck) {
    const index = queue.shift(); // Dequeue the front index
    result[index] = card; // Set the value in the result array
    if (queue.length > 0) {
      const nextIndex = queue.shift(); // Dequeue the front index again
      queue.push(nextIndex); // Enqueue the index at the end of the queue
    }
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(deckRevealedIncreasing([17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7])); // Output: [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7]
console.log(deckRevealedIncreasing([1, 1000])); // Output: [1, 1000]
