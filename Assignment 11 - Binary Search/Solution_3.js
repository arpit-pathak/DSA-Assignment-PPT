// 💡 **Question 3**

// Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array.*

// **Example 1:**

// Input: nums = [3,0,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

// **Example 2:**

// Input: nums = [0,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

// **Example 3:**

// Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
